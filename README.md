# Fashion-MNIST-Convolutional-Neural-Network-Visualization
  This repository contains a Python script implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for the Fashion MNIST dataset. The script covers model training, evaluation, and visualization of         convolutional layer outputs for specific images.

# Prerequisites
  Python 3.x
  TensorFlow
  Matplotlib

# Model Architecture
  The CNN model architecture includes convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, a flatten layer, and dense layers. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss.
  
# Visualization
  The script includes visualization of convolutional layer outputs for specific images from the Fashion MNIST test set. Feature maps from different convolutional layers are displayed for interpretability.

# Contributions
  Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or suggest improvements.
